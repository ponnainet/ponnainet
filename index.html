        <p>Hi there! This is a tutorial on how to set up a simple static website with

            <!--This is a link. It contains the website we link to as a href (hypertext reference)-->
            <!--as well as the clickable link text. Here, we're linking to pages.github.com and display -->
            <!--the term Github Pages-->
            <!-- Here's how links work generally: <a href="website-we-link.to">Clickable link text</a>-->

            created by <a href="http://web.mit.edu/crystall/www/">Crystal Lee</a> and
            <a href="http://stanford.edu/~risi/">Stephan Risi</a>. You can also have a look at the
            <a href="https://github.com/srisi/github_pages_tutorial">underlying Github repository</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The beauty of using Github Pages is that you don’t need to worry about hosting or
            setting up your own server. You can just create and edit html files and they will
            be immediately available to everyone. This tutorial is inspired by a similar
            <a href="http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w19/tutorials-guides/web-development/publish-your-website-with-github-pages/">tutorial</a>
            created by <a href="http://miriamposner.com/">Miriam Posner</a>, who has also
            <a href="http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w19/final-project/building-your-project-site/">written
                about the advantages and disadvantages of using Github Pages</a> in more detail.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will walk you through the process of setting up a <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>
            account, making edits to the page, and using it as a place to host your own work.
