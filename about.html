    <div class="header-01"><h2><strong>STATEMENT OF ARTISTIC PRACTICE</strong></h2></div>

	<p>My artistic practice is situated within the field of contemporary visual art and it is focused within the methodology of conceptual art. 
	Here, when one considers conceptual art, it primarily means that, within my practice, the conceptual framework within which I make certain 
	works of art is more important than the material execution when creating the artwork. Presently, the most important focus of my artistic practice 
	is within the field of traditional craft and traditional visual practices. I use traditional practices as a medium in which I create my conceptual 
	visual artworks.</p>
    
    <p>When creating conceptual artworks, the methods and visual aesthetics found in traditional visual practices are often a thematic base for the creation 
    of conceptual artworks. I often transform the methods and aesthetics that traditional craft and traditional visual practices use, and through conceptual 
    transformation, I make new artworks which are governed by new conceptual frameworks. These conceptual transformations of both traditional methods 
    and traditional aesthetics are of my own creation and the importance of these conceptual frameworks always outweighs the importance of the material 
    execution of any artwork. </p>
    
    <p>The primary intention behind the creation of my conceptual artworks is to give the viewer new perspectives in which historical situations can be 
    understood. The artwork I create is intended to give a new lens to the viewer in order to understand and reinterpret historical situations. Here, the 
    historical past, historical present, and historical futures are all intended as thematic subjects which my conceptual artworks conceptually address. 
    I use traditional craft and traditional visual practices in order to address certain historical conditions. Through the employment of transformed 
    traditional visual practices as a methodology, I strive to give new perspectives and new interpretations on historical conditions. </p>
    
    <p>Traditional craft and traditional visual practices, the frameworks of which, once transformed, form a crucial methodological foundation and 
    provide a base from which I can develop a conceptual framework in which historical conditions can be reinterpreted and understood from a new 
    perspective. I employ these traditional visual practices not as static references to heritage, but as active conceptual frameworks through which 
    historical conditions can be critically examined. By subjecting traditional methodologies to the processes of conceptual transformation, I intend 
    to provide re-contextualization and reinterpretations of historical conditions in order to understand historical conditions anew. </p>
    
    <div class="header-01"><h2><strong>ABOUT</strong></h2></div>
    
    <p>My journey in the visual arts began in childhood, when I spent much of my time drawing and painting. During high school, I further developed my 
    technical skills, continuing as a largely self-taught artist. Drawing and painting were my primary interests growing up, which led me to pursue 
    formal studies in visual arts in college. I undertook my studies at <a href="https://www.bennington.edu/">Bennington College</a> in Vermont, United States, where I received a rigorous, 
    multidisciplinary education in the visual arts which included studies in drawing, painting, digital art, ceramics, sculpture, and architecture.</p> 
    
    <p>At Bennington, as a small liberal arts college, the emphasis of education was multidisciplinary. Therefore, I not only studied visual arts but also 
    pursued courses in the sciences, such as mathematics and biology, as well as in the social sciences, including anthropology, economics, political economy, 
    and history. My explorations in these fields provided a foundation for conceptual inquiry within the visual arts. I began approaching visual art through 
    analysis and conceptual development rooted in the sciences and social sciences, and this method of inquiry laid the groundwork for my engagement with 
    conceptual art.</p>
    
    <p>Following my studies in the United States, I undertook further academic training in Graphic Design at <a href="https://aeu.edu.my/">Asia e University</a> in Malaysia. This program 
    provided advanced technical training in digital arts, enabling me to develop a high level of proficiency in digital tools, software, and contemporary 
    digital production techniques. Beyond technical proficiency, the program offered a structured platform for critical exploration of digital visual practices, 
    encompassing both illustrative work and projects grounded in conceptually driven frameworks.</p>
