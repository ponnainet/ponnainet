    <h3><b><u>Teaching of Mughal Floral Art</b> — In Collaboration with Jaipur Rugs Foundation</u></h3>
    <h4>Jaipur, Rajasthan, India — 2023</h4>   
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Jaipur Rugs Foundation in collaboration with Jaipur Rugs Company works in rural villages in North
India to produce high quality rugs. I taught drawing and painting to these artisans in the hopes of developing their creativity so that they can improve their rug weaving skills. The theme was Mughal Floral Motifs. Mughal art is a significant part of their history, however, it is now not practiced by many. Mughal Floral Motifs is an element which is vanishing in the traditional arts and crafts of India and my intention was to reintroduce this practice to the artisans who make these rugs. 
</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A series of workshops in drawing and painting were conducted to over 70 participants which consisted of drawing and painting workshops which focused on their technical ability and also gave the artisans a thematic framework for creative expression. After the initial series of workshops, the number of participants reduced and only a 
        handful went on to the final stage of the project. The entire program was done within a span of four months and a select few artisans went on to make final paintings on canvases. The artisans who made final works on canvas got the opportunity to showcase their work in a final 
        exhibition which was held at Jawahar Kala Kendra in Jaipur.</p>
<p>Photographs of my students and their final works on canvas are below:</p>
